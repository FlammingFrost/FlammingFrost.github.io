Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Lifan Lin (Hugo)**, currently a master's student in Data Science at Stanford University. Passionated about data-centric machine learning, data analysis, and applied machine learning.

There're links to my lifestyle-blog and learning log on your left:

- **Lifestyle-blog**: Some creations, some experiences, and some thoughts. Mainly about my life and my feelings.
- **Learning log**: Some notes, some projects, and some thoughts. Showcasing some of my works and thoughts in the field of data science and machine learning.

But here, I will keep it simple. Probably some brief updates of myself and some featured articles.
