## Why Build This Blog?

In topics like machine learning, we prefer the word "human" than "people". Humans are always alone, but they sometimes have a desire to share. I am not the exception.

Happiness and sorrow are companions in life, and they all turn into precious memories when we look back. I want to share you some of my valuable experiences, in a hope to speed you up in your journey, if you are currently stuck in some problems or at the crossroads of life.
